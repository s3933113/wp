            <h2>Brief Bio</h2>
            <p>For most of my professional career, of 20 plus years, I spent in the Software Engineering field where I
                gained a broad
                practical experience in front and back-end development. Also for three years prior to joining RMIT, I
                held the position
                of Enterprise Architect in a large transformational project at the Bureau of Meteorology. I have solid
                industry
                experience that includes modern technologies. I have been teaching at RMIT since 2020.
